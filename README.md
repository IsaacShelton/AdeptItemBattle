# AdeptItemBattle
Item Battle Game that I made in a few hours using Adept

### Cross Platform
Runs on Windows and Mac without any modifications

### Controls
- '1' through '5' to choose order of items
- 'space' to progress through battles

### Game Assets
- https://opengameart.org/content/4-color-dawnbringer-icons-for-adventurerpg
- https://opengameart.org/content/castle-background

### How to compile
Make sure your compiler supports version `2.6`

Navigate to the root of the project and run
`adept`

After that, you can optionally use a tool like `iexpress` to create a self-extracting executable that's bundled with the required assets and DLLs or use a tool like `Inno Setup` to create an installer.
